Hope, and the process of reconstructing the Taino language by means of comparative linguistics 
</h1>
</center>
<p>
I've seen claims that the Taino language has far too little documented evidence to ever possibly reconstruct a faithful Classical Taino. However, I believe through lots of effort put into analysis of cognates and grammar in closely related languages like Lokono, a comparative reconstruction can be successful. It has been estimated that the surviving vocabulary of Taino is 95% nouns, due to the Spanish colonizers only taking words for new places or concepts, and rarely actually learning the language.
</p>
<p>
Nominal and verbal gaps can be filled, not by direct loaning of words from related languages, but by reconstruction of a Proto-Ta-Maripurian language by means of comparing cognates across not only Ta-Maripurian languages, but also by applying regular sound changes from a Proto-Arawakan language. Once this is done, analysis of differences between it and surviving Taino can be done, in order to compile the most common sound changes. Then, these sound changes can be systematically applied in order to recreate the theoretical Taino words. These words will more faithfully fill lexical gaps, and work to remove the influence of colonization. 
</p>
<p>
While easier, the direct loaning of words from other languages can overtime obscure what little we have left of Classical Taino, and discourage deeper research. I have also seen a dangerous trend of loaning Spanish words into reconstructions of Taino. This just remakes the problem all over again, with words from Spanish being used where native words could flourish, and should be avoided at all costs. 
</p>
<p>
This same concept can also be applied to grammar and syntax, to a lesser extent. There is much less data to work with in order to reconstruct a fully functioning system, especially with a language as morphemically complex and polysythetic as Taino. Even things as fundamental as word order are frequently debated, especially because some attested phrases conflict, and may point to Taino having irregular word order. The rules that govern this irregularity can only be guessed at, unless a comparable system can be found in related languages.
</p>
<p>
However difficult it may be, I am optimistic that myself and other amateur and professional linguists, with much collaboration, can reconstruct a much more robust and practical Classical Taino within perhaps less than a decade. This area of study is not a lost cause, as some have made it out to be, but rather simply under-researched.
